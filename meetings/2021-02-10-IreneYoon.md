title: "Logical Equivalences for Monads"
speaker: "Irene Yoon"
semester: "SP21"

Abstract--
My aim for this talk is to have a grounds-up guided tour that builds 
towards a generalized equational theory for monads.

The plan is as follows...
(1) Review of homework: notions of observational equivalence
      and connection to logical equivalence.
(2) STLC with encapsulation of state
     (extremely simplified presentation of calculus and logical 
      relations from "A Logical Relation for Monadic Encapsulation 
      of State" by A. Timany et al. POPL 2018).
(3) Peeking into a bag of monads (nondeterminism, exception, 
     Interaction Trees), with an eye towards a general characterization
     of monadic equivalences and relevant computational 
     characteristics.

Homework--
Review notions of observational equivalence and its relation to 
logical equivalence by reading:
