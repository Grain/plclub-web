This Friday I will be presenting the distinguished paper “Liquid Information Flow Control” by Nadia Polykarpova et al from ICFP 2020. Here’s a link if you’d like to have a look ahead of the talk. I like this paper because it combines promising techniques from type theory, program synthesis and logic to tackle a decades old problem of computer security in a new and interesting way.

I plan to give a brief overview of Information Flow Control and some Security Monads before going into the paper to set the context. It would be good to have some familiarity with liquid types ahead of time. I suggest going through this LiquidHaskell tutorial by Andres Löh, especially sections 1.2-1.11 and attempting the exercises in 1.11, also section 2.1-2.6 on lists and sections 3.1-3.2 on uninterpreted functions.
