Abstract: This Friday we will study the question "What is equality?"
which is, in fact, a PL question. What are its properties? What are its
models? Is it even a thing? The identity of equality has eluded
generations of PLosophers, so don't expect answers, but at the end of
the day everyone will be served a bit of homotopy type theory.

Homework: A little logic exercise to warm up (5-10min).

Let x, y be two elements of some type/set A.
We say that x and y are Leibniz-eq if "every thing true of x is true of
y": for all predicates P : A -> Prop (in your favorite logic, mechanized
or not), P x implies P y.

Show that "Leibniz-eq" is an equivalence relation, i.e.:
1. for all x : A, x and x are Leibniz-eq;
2. for all x, y : A, if x and y are Leibniz-eq, then y and x are Leibniz-eq
3. for all x, y, z : A, if x and y are Leibniz-eq, and y and z are
Leibniz-eq, then x and z are Leibniz-eq.

Bonus points: find two versions of the proofs of (2) and (3), one where
you instantiate a "Leibniz-eq" hypothesis with a predicate P which
mentions Leibniz-eq ("impredicative" solution), and another where your P
doesn't mention Leibniz-eq ("predicative" solution).
