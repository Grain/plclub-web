Abstract:

Algebraic data types are a staple of functional programming. In this
talk, we will go back in time to the origins of algebraic data types.
What is "algebraic" about algebraic data types? How did researchers of
the time think about them? This adventure is an opportunity to shed some
light into the evolution of functional programming and how it represents
"a radical attack on the whole programming enterprise"[1].

Optional homework:

- Review the notion of algebraic data types (also called variants) in
your favorite programming language (even if it is C++ [2]). Two good
places for catching up are OCaml's manual[3] and the Wikipedia article[4].

- Review the definition of an algebra[5] (in the sense of "universal
algebra"). To point out the relevant sections of the Wikipedia article:
get the "Basic idea", see how some of the "Examples" fit the definition,
and also check out the definition of a homomorphism (in "Basic
constructions").
