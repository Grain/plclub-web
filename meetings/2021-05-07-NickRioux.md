Abstract:
In the past couple of years, research has hinted that the typed merge operator,
together with intersection types, offers a glimpse of a radically compositional
style of programming in which the expression problem does not exist: data types
and their operations can be extended naturally. Unfortunately, the merge
operator is also an unwieldy beast. Merges of 'overlapping' values are
ambiguous, so a notion of disjointness between types is required to rule out
nondeterminism statically and obtain a well-behaved semantics.

In this talk, I will introduce the merge operator and disjointness through the
lens of a calculus I have been devising with Steve. If time allows we will see
see an application to the expression problem.

Homework:
If you are unfamiliar with the expression problem, then read this short email from
Phil Wadler.

Otherwise, I would suggest reading section 2 of Distributive Disjoint Polymorphism for Compositional Programming or skimming the examples in the upcoming paper Compositional Programming.
