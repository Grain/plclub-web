On Friday, I'll present our ongoing work that utilize interaction trees in testing networked servers.

Preview: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~yishuai/itree-testing.pdf

Homework:
Please review concepts in interaction trees, especially "interpretation", which was introduced in "Interaction trees: representing recursive and impure programs in Coq "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3371119 . The paper draft above doesn't assume readers' knowledge of ITrees, but the talk might involve some discussion on ITrees.
